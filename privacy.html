        </p>
        <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>This website uses technical cookies (small files with information that the server sends to the computer of
            the website user) in order to carry out certain functions considered necessary for the correct functioning
            and preview of the website. In any case, the cookies used are temporary, with the sole purpose of making
            navigation of the site more efficient, and disappear at the end of the user&rsquo;s session. Under no
            circumstances do these cookies themselves provide personal data and will not be used for the collection of
            such data.</p>
        <p>Through using cookies, it is also possible for the server where the website is located to recognise the
            browser used by the user in order to make navigation easier, allowing, for example, users who have
            previously registered to access the areas, services, promotions or contests reserved exclusively for them
            without having to register on each visit. They may also be used to measure the audience or traffic
            parameters, monitor the progress and number of entries, etc. In these cases, the cookies used are
            technically non-essential but beneficial to the user. This website will not install non-essential cookies
            without previous user consent.</p>
        <p>The browser may be configured by the user to alert them of the reception of cookies and to prevent their
            installation on their computer. For further information, please consult the instructions of your browser.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Link policy</strong></p>
        <p>The user of this website may be redirected to content from third party websites. Since the CONTROLLER cannot
            always control the contents of third party websites, they do not assume any type of responsibility with
            respect to said contents. In any case, the CONTROLLER will immediately remove any content that may be in
            breach of national or international laws, morality or public order, and will immediately remove the
            redirection to this website, informing the competent authorities of the content in question.</p>
        <p>The CONTROLLER will not be responsible for the information and content found, including but not limited to,
            in forums, chats, blog generators, comments, social networks or any other means that allows third parties to
            publish content independently on the website of the CONTROLLER. However, and in accordance with Acts 11 and
            16 of the LSSICE, third party content is made available to all users, authorities, and law enforcement
            bodies collaborating directly on the withdrawal or blocking of all content that may affect or violate
            national or international law, third party rights or public morals and public order. In the event that the
            user considers there to be any content on the website that could be considered as such, please notify the
            website administrator immediately.</p>
        <p>This website was revised and tested to enable its correct functioning. In principle, proper functioning can
            be guaranteed 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. However, the CONTROLLER does not rule out the possibility of
            there being certain programming errors, or that force majeure, natural disasters, strikes or similar
            circumstances may occur that make accessing the website impossible.</p>
        <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
        <p>The website servers can detect automatically the IP address and the domain name used by the user. An IP
            address is a number assigned automatically to a computer when connected to the Internet. All of
            thisinformation is recorded in a system log on the server that allows the subsequent processing of the data
            in order to obtain only statistical measurements that show us the number of page hits, the number of visits
            made to the web servers, the order of visits, the access point, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>4. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</strong></p>
        <p>Spanish law, to which the parties expressly submit themselves, will apply to all disputes or questions
            related to this website or the activities carried out on it, and the Courts and Tribunals closest to Sant
            Miquel de Fluvià shall be responsible for the resolution of all conflicts arising from or related to its
            use.

            as there are legal prescriptions dictating their custody, and when such purpose is no longer necessary the
            data shall be erased with appropriate security measures to ensure the anonymization of the data or their
            complete destruction.</p>
        <p><strong>&iquest;To whom do we disclose your personal data?</strong></p>
        <p>No communication of personal data to third parties is foreseen except, if necessary for the development and
            execution of the purposes of the processing, to our suppliers of services related to communications, with
            which the CONTROLLER has signed the confidentiality and data processor contracts required by current privacy
            regulations.</p>

        <p>Right to withdraw consent at any time.<br />Right of access, rectification, portability and erasure of
            your data and the limitation or objection to their processing.<br />The right to file a claim with the
