        Use of Cookies<br />
        This website uses technical cookies (small files with information that the server sends to the computer of the
        website user) in order to carry out certain functions considered necessary for the correct functioning and
        preview of the website. In any case, the cookies used are temporary, with the sole purpose of making navigation
        of the site more efficient, and disappear at the end of the user’s session. Under no circumstances do these
        cookies themselves provide personal data and will not be used for the collection of such data.<br />
        Through using cookies, it is also possible for the server where the website is located to recognise the browser
        used by the user in order to make navigation easier, allowing, for example, users who have previously registered
        to access the areas, services, promotions or contests reserved exclusively for them without having to register
        on each visit. They may also be used to measure the audience or traffic parameters, monitor the progress and
        number of entries, etc. In these cases, the cookies used are technically non-essential but beneficial to the
        user. This website will not install non-essential cookies without previous user consent.<br />
        The browser may be configured by the user to alert them of the reception of cookies and to prevent their
        installation on their computer. For further information, please consult the instructions of your browser.<br />
        Link policy<br />
        The user of this website may be redirected to content from third party websites. Since the CONTROLLER cannot
        always control the contents of third party websites, they do not assume any type of responsibility with respect
        to said contents. In any case, the CONTROLLER will immediately remove any content that may be in breach of
        national or international laws, morality or public order, and will immediately remove the redirection to this
        website, informing the competent authorities of the content in question.<br />
        The CONTROLLER will not be responsible for the information and content found, including but not limited to, in
        forums, chats, blog generators, comments, social networks or any other means that allows third parties to
        publish content independently on the website of the CONTROLLER. However, and in accordance with Acts 11 and 16
        of the LSSICE, third party content is made available to all users, authorities, and law enforcement bodies
        collaborating directly on the withdrawal or blocking of all content that may affect or violate national or
        international law, third party rights or public morals and public order. In the event that the user considers
        there to be any content on the website that could be considered as such, please notify the website administrator
        immediately.<br />
        This website was revised and tested to enable its correct functioning. In principle, proper functioning can be
        guaranteed 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. However, the CONTROLLER does not rule out the possibility of there
        being certain programming errors, or that force majeure, natural disasters, strikes or similar circumstances may
        occur that make accessing the website impossible.<br />
        IP Addresses<br />
        The website servers can detect automatically the IP address and the domain name used by the user. An IP address
        is a number assigned automatically to a computer when connected to the Internet. All of this information is recorded in a system log on the server that allows the subsequent processing of the data in order
        to obtain only statistical measurements that show us the number of page hits, the number of visits made to the
        web servers, the order of visits, the access point, etc.<br />
        4. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION<br />
        Spanish law, to which the parties expressly submit themselves, will apply to all disputes or questions related
        to this website or the activities carried out on it, and the Courts and Tribunals closest to Sant Miquel de
        Fluvià shall be responsible for the resolution of all conflicts arising from or related to its use.<br />
